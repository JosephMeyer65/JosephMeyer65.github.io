    <p>GCFLearnFree Search better and TutorialsPoint search engines:
	Learning about being able to search for something on Google and then use the tools to help refine searches like searching for a particular color of something or a specific size, is actually really useful and not something I knew I could do until now, along with learning about the advanced search which I had heard about before but never explored. I could see myself using googles tools to help my daily searches and the advanced search to hopefully help with research topics for classes. Learning that Google can do geometry was sort of a huge shocker, I thought I had to go to a website specifically for math for something more complicated like that. Learning how a search engine functions was a bit eye opening, it’s a tool that I use in my everyday life and in my school life but am only now learning the details of how it works. Using a crawler to search for relevant information, collecting urls and then indexing them in a large database to organize them and then when you enter a search it tries to search the index with a relevant result, I’m sure that every web browser has a different definition of relevant, depending on your needs you may want a different web browser, learning this has somewhat opened my eyes and made me want to test every different web browser to see which one will suit my needs best, both in my daily life and perhaps my school life.
Compare Search Engines: 
I searched the term “Web search engine” On Google, Yahoo, ask.com. and Bing, First thing I noted was that Yahoo was the slowest, I used the same computer for all of these searches and did them one after another, not all at the same time and yet Yahoo was noticeably slower, as for the search results, Google actually came up with Brave.com first, which happens to be another search engine, I assume that it came up with that because I had downloaded it earlier to test Brave along with other Search engines. Yahoo came up with a Lifewire article titled “8 Search Engines to try in 2025” as the first result, Ask gave me an article from reference.com titled “What is the difference between a web browser and a search engine?” Which I find to be the most interesting first result, and finally Bing gave me the same Lifewire article as Yahoo. I used Google to search for “search engine market share” and the first result was one from statcounter.com which shows that google is very far ahead of the other competition shown on this website, that competition being Bing, Yandex, Yahoo, and Baidu. What I learned from this was that if I have a question it wouldn’t hurt to spread my net a little wider to see what other answers I get, which could be especially useful for studying, I might find articles and studies that others might never see because all they use is Google.
