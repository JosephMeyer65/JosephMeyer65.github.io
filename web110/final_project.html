    <p>I feel as if I learned a wide variety of basics this semester. I learned about the internet, what it is and how it works, I learned that I didn’t like Google that much and ended up testing a bunch of different things and I have mostly switched over to Opera Gx. I learned the very basics of coding, which I found to be the most interesting part of this class. Learning how to work with and do even the basics of HTML made me incredibly excited as it's what I want to do for my future job. I didn’t even know what CSS was until I took this class and was excited to learn about that as well, as it appears that’s how I stylize and make websites look nicer. I learned that even though I love technology and want to work with it in the future, using physical notes is the best way to do things sometimes, at least for me. I also learned a lot about databases along with how difficult they can be to navigate, although SQL helps with that a lot. Overall, I feel like I had a good introduction to what my future classes will hopefully build a lot on.
