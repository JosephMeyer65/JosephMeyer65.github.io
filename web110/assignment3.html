    <h1>assignment3</h1><p>GCF Global: Email Basics and Tutorials Point Email Overview:
	While I have an email account, I have not used it much other than to make accounts on different websites, so it was interesting to know that I can do things besides email on my email, like noting down my schedule and sharing it with others, you can eve have apparently multiple calendars to organize different aspects of your life, like your personal and professional life, which I’m sure will be helpful in the business world and on vacations. I was also unaware of email etiquette, when I was younger I had written physical mail in school as an English lesson, when I had used email previously I just wrote like I would in any other text message thinking it was basically the same, but from now on I’ll be including a greeting in all of my emails and trying to seem more professional as I believe it will help me later when I get a career. Something else I learned is that everything has shortcuts, like c to compose, e for archive, and # to delete. I’ll be trying to study a few more later to make sending and sorting through my inbox easier. Since I don’t send many emails I didn’t think much about the different parts of an email, I did recognize the terms for most parts of the email other than CC and BCC. CC apparently stands for carbon copy which includes people we want to keep informed, and BCC stands for black carbon copy, BCC protects people’s contact information by not showing all of the recipients’ emails, which I could see used more in the business world than in my personal life. I had never thought about the cost of an email, because creating and sending emails are free but on tutorialspoint.com it said emails were inexpensive, which made me think, how much does it cost to send an email? I ended up googling it and according to mailmeteor.com its about 1 dollar for ten thousand emails, which I think I will be using on trivia night.</p>

	While I’m very aware of spam, and phishing when it comes to texts and calls however, because I don’t pay much attention to my email inbox, I wasn’t aware of how devious it can be. The thing I’m referring to is the worm code, a program that can find its way in an infected computer, through contacts and sending forged emails to other contacts is not something I knew could happen and it makes me wonder if that could be done over text as well. On the previous activity I was all excited about learning how to send professional looking emails and before I do that more often, I’m happy to learn of another scam to look out for. Learning how to use the google admin toolbox was super neat and will help me in my personal life to not get caught up in a spoofed email scam, I know any time I feel suspicious about an email I can use the google admin toolbox to help me verify the email, when I did this as a test I decided to test an email from Amazon as I knew it wasn’t spoofed and I wasn’t sure if I had any scam or spam emails in my inbox at the time. While I was happy to learn about how many different countermeasures there where to prevent email spoofing and scams, such as more email authentication methods such as DomainKeys Identified Mail, and Sender Policy Framework, along with ways to prevent yourself from getting scammed if those fail like with the google admin toolbox, it makes me wonder if there should be more restrictions on emails? Like you can only have a certain number of emails tied to one IP address perhaps? However, I immediately see how that could be problematic when businesses have many employees with a business email address.</p>
<p>TutorialsPoint: Social Networking:
	Most of the time my friends have to force me to join another social media platform, my friends forced me to join Snapchat, and I use it to talk to my friends that prefer snapchat, they send me videos and pictures of the things they’re doing or stuff they thought was cool, but I don’t personally enjoy doing that because I can’t see their live reaction to something unless we are in a video call, so while snapchat is neat and it’s a convenient place to chat with friends I am often wondering why my friends prefer snapchat rather than just texting me. I do like Twitter, or X as it’s called now, but I don’t post, I just follow a few content creators that I like, to see when they’re streaming, or putting out a new video, or any other sort of updates on the content I prefer to watch. YouTube is a social media platform I frequent because I have found so many content creators I like, and enjoy watching, anything from outdoors content, to gaming, and cooking, it feels like I can find any kind of content I enjoy on YouTube. Another Social media platform I really like is Reddit, yes it has all the different kinds of content I like on there as well, much like with YouTube, but it also appears that whenever I have a tech problem some one else has posted about it on Reddit, and had some one else reply to help them fix said issue. Reddit is honestly a life saver for me whenever I have some kind of tech problem. Lastly my most used social media platform is Discord, I have a lot of friends from around the world, and we all like to play games or watch shows together, I find discord to be the easiest place to connect with them in our private servers where we can chat about our lives, or get in a group call to play games or maybe watch a movie, Discord honestly sometimes feels like it helps close the gaps even when friends are really far.</p>
<p>TutorialsPoint Internet Services:
	After doing the social media activity I found it very interesting how many social media platforms are basically a lot of different internet communication services combined into one thing, for example Reddit is basically a newsgroup that also has instant messaging and internet relay chat, and Discord has instant messaging, internet relay chat, and internet telephony. When I saw Telnet listed as a service I thought it was referring to the Team Viewer program that grants you remote access to another person’s computer, but when I googled it I realized I was thinking of something else, and ended up reading part of the wiki on Telnet, seeing that it was used for remote management off routers, which was very neat, I had always wondered how when I called my ISP they were able to reset and change some settings from the office, while I don’t see how I can use this information currently perhaps if I go into the IT field, which I am considering, I might get to use something like this. I had typed in the WWW many times without knowing it stood for World wide web, even though I have said those exact words many, many times, I always just thought it was part of the websites address that had no meaning, but I am now learning that every single part of a computer, and aspects of the internet have some reason for being there, as I’m reading about this I’m learning to be more curious and to ask more questions. Learning about some of the history of search engines with Archie, considered the worlds first engine, the gopher, protocol, and the rather cleverly named Veronica was interesting and it made me realize how far we’ve come with search engines like yahoo and google, the tutorials point didn’t have much information on them so I ended up looking them up and reading about them on the wiki, and I will be adding the question, while interesting I think the only things I can use this information for is on a quiz about internet history or for some small talk with friends.</p>
