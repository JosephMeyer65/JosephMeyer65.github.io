    <p>Messing around with css was fun, I took a graphics art class before this, and it vaguely reminded me of that. Using css to change the design, and layout can be useful, I’m sure I’ve only barely scratched the surface of what I can do by changing the background color, font size, the font itself, and where the text is placed, and I’m eager to do more. Learning css will help me in my future because I am still planning on becoming a web developer. Css seems like another basic yet very necessary tool to be able to use considering my future career choice.</p>
