    <p>Messing around with css was pretty fun, I took a graphics art class before this class and it vaguely reminded me of that, because after developing a website, using css to change the design, and layout can be really useful, im sure I’ve only barely scratched the surface of what I can do by changing the background color, font size, the font itself, and where the text is placed, and I’m eager too do more. I can definitely see me using this in the future when creating websites, to get them looking a particular way and also help me make a website that looks good.</p>
