    <h1>assignment4b</h1><p>I have had my fair share of people hacking into my online accounts and my passwords becoming compromised, so the how to create a strong password section did feel helpful, I have resorted to using password generators before or spamming mindlessly on my keyboard until I create a super long password that I can’t remember and then writing it down, having the trick with the Jack and Jill went up the hill, and using the first word of every letter will help me create more memorable passwords in the future to better protect myself. We talked a little bit about domain names before and I remembered to look for the little padlock, however I never thought to manually update my browser as I always thought that was done automatically. I will be checking that from time to time to make sure I am as protected as possible against spyware and other malicious malware on the internet. I do use Google mail and it’s good to know I can choose to have it ask before showing images in my email, something I will probably have it set to despite my curious nature whenever there is something I can’t see. I was unaware of the trick that I could just type in the URL rather than click it to make sure I went to the right website, and I will be using that in the future to make sure I do not fall for any phishing emails in the future. Just like with my browser I’ve always let my computer update itself automatically and didn’t know that sometimes it updated late, I will be regularly checking for windows updates from now on to keep my computer safer. I really liked the think before you share video, even though I don’t post much on social media I thought it was a nice reminder to both myself and everyone that what you share on the internet can be seen by anyone, anywhere, and can affect you in ways you might not realize right away. I have had viruses on my computer before and I’m happy to learn that I followed all the steps to remove the virus, with a system scan and antivirus software, the one I used at the time was Norton and I was happy to see it suggested because it was the one I used. It made me feel like even though I wasn’t entirely sure of what I was doing I did the right thing. Last thing to note that I learned was to check scam emails for spelling errors or bad grammar which I had never thought of but will start doing.</p>
  <p>I already use Googles password manager for the websites I visit on google, I switched to Opera Gx for web browsing after the web browser assignment, and after testing multiple web browsers, however it let me transfer all the passwords very easily,  Having another password manager for the rest of the passwords I have sounds convenient considering how many different accounts I have on different websites. After reading about the different types of password managers Local sounds like the safest best and cloud-based sounds like the most convenient to me, considering the fact that I don’t have a ton of different devices that I need to sync up I would probably use a local password manager. I went with KeePassXC, mostly because it looked the most modern, when I downloaded it, it also said it had a browser extension which I thought was cool. After installation I thought it was very interesting that I could change settings for decryption times to make things more convenient for myself having the databases open faster, or for the database to take longer to open but for them to be more secure, so that you can tailor your experience to your needs. It also lets you add a key file for additional security, additionally you can also add a challenge response that would require you to use something like a YubiKey or an OnlyKey to get access to your passwords. Before downloading this, I didn’t see the appeal but after testing it, even very briefly I can see why people use a password manager to keep themselves, just that much safer. I was already aware off Multi factor authentication and do use it for many things including my email and many other accounts I have with different websites, I just use my phone for the Multi factor authentication, however after getting the password manager I am considering getting something like a Yubikey, because I have had difficulties with my email accounts and other accounts getting hacked before.</p>
