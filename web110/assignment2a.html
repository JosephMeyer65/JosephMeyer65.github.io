    <p>Completed tutorials point web browser and GCF Learn free Internet tips
	While I learned some of the information on URLs in the previous assignment, it was still very interesting about the chain of events that happen for a computer and a website to communicate to load another website on a web browser. Learning about the terms controllers, interpreters, and client programs has made me think about how my computer works differently, it’s not just a mouse, its something that sends a signal to my computer and is then interpreted into visual information, Learning this while not super helpful right off the bat definitely makes it feel like I’m peeking behind the curtain and beginning my adventure to understand my computer better. Before Today I had didn’t even know that I could get an email account through my internet service provider, which after reading more about it I will never do, and I will happily stick with my Google mail account. Learning about my browsers status bar and having another way to protect myself against potentially harmful threats, and I will be looking at my browser’s status bar all the time now. Learning how to fix broken links if they are in fact fixable will be a huge boon for me even before I get my chosen career, I know now that if a link isn’t broken I can remove punctuation at the end of a link, try to fix syntax errors like if there isn’t a “.com” at the end of a link, along with some other tricks to try and make it work.
Practice using web browser: Chrome:
	Learning some shortcuts on my keyboard to do things like Open a new window with ctrl+n opening a new tab with ctrl+t switching between tabs with ctrl+tab and closing a tab with ctrl+W was definitely nice, I believe this will help me in the future to scour the internet faster and hopefully more efficiently.  I was very happy to learn about my chosen browser’s security features. I will be looking for the little padlock icon for every site I visit from now on, and while I’m not sure what I would need to delete my browsing history for, or why I would need incognito mode but, knowing I have those options is nice. Learning that each google tab was its own individual instance was very interesting to me because I had never thought of it, nor had I ever had a google tab crash on me so I never knew that if a google tab crashed that didn’t mean all my google tabs would crash, thanks to what they call sandboxing. Knowing that I can manage cookies and turn them on or off depending on if I trust the website will help me stay safer on the internet. Another thing that I’m sure will help me stay safer on the internet is using the chrome web store to download the suggested AdBlock plus extension so that I can browse without ads, some of which supposedly have viruses or malware.
