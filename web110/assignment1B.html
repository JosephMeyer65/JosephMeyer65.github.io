    <p>Internet basics
I Learned that we have subsea cables that send most of our international information under the water. I never really thought about how many cables were used to create the system we use today which allows us to communicate with anyone, anywhere in the world, while I can’t apply this information directly, currently it helps me understand the tools I’m currently using better. I learned about URLs I can now read the different parts of a URL and understand what the URL will lead to by looking at the domain name parameter string and the Anchor if its available. Learning this was kind of exciting because I think this feels like the first step to computer literacy.  I learned how to better use and refine my searches while using google. I learned I was able to use quotation marks and hyphens to help me include and exclude certain words, this will help me a lot when I study topics for other classes and in everyday life when I’m trying to look things up.</p>
<p>Internet Technologies
I learned what an IP address is, which is essentially your computers address, almost like your homes address but for your computer,  while I had known of and used IP addresses before when I did things like, make a Minecraft server, I wasn’t entirely aware of what they were, Learning more about IP addresses and DNSs, will probably help me a lot more later as I learn HTML. Learning about the history of the internet or its original name ARPANET was very interesting, I can’t imagine using this information for anything other than some really fun trivia when I hang out with my nerdy friends who will probably find it interesting that the internet was originally developed by the united states department of defense, with the intention of it just to be used as a tool for the government to communicate with itself better.</p>
