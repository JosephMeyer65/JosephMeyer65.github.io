    <h1>assignment4a</h1><p>Tutorials Point Internet reference models, internet protocols, and internet domain name system:
Learning about the Open system interface model was interesting and also the most complicated thing that we have covered so far, at least to me, as I understand it, it explains how data is transferred to one computer to another over and the internet regardless of how different their network devices are from our own. Perhaps it’s just me but reading about the TCP/IP model was much less of a headache and made much more sense, maybe because there are less layers to it. You connect with the application layer, and it can provide different services, the transport layer TCP which establishes a connection first before sending packets over the internet layer, or the UDP protocol which sends packets before establishing a connection. I thought the most interesting part of the internet protocols overview was about the difference between FTP and TFTP, knowing that they both are for similar things, transferring files, but they use different protocols, one uses TCP and the other uses UDP which is less reliable, TFTP also doesn’t require any authentication which makes it more vulnerable, while the lesson didn’t provide any examples of these being used I still find it interesting to know the differences and I look forward to learning how I might use this information in the future, also breaking down Hyper Text Transfer protocol or HTTP, was also fun to learn about because of how often I see HTTP on websites, I now know that it’s a mechanism for communication between browser and web server, and that it has two parts, a request and a response. Learning about what all the different domain names mean was helpful, now whenever I visit a website, I know exactly what the domains name means and what kind of information might be available due to that. I also learned that there are different country top level domain names which was interesting. Learning all these things including what a Domain name Space is, along with its hierarchy in the internet naming structure, the types of name servers which until now I just thought there was one not three which are the root servers, primary servers, and secondary servers. Root servers, to my understanding Have the information of the DNS tree and delegates authority to the other servers because it doesn’t contain the information about the domains, it seems like its like a directory. Like the root leads to everything else. The primary servers where files are created, maintained, and updated, and the secondary server transfers complete information about a zone from another server. I can see how learning all of this will help me in the future as I want to be a web developer, so learning how websites, servers, and how networks function will help me in my future.</p>
   <p>Review IP address settings for your local network.
I started by reviewing how to fix my network adapter problems which was fun. I now know how to run the troubleshooter which I will try the next time I have a slow internet connection or perhaps an outage. I then learned how to change the settings on my local Wi-Fi, which I’m unsure of what I would use for currently. I already have my IP setting set to Automatic (DHCP) which uses the settings from my router so I don’t know why I would need to manually set my Ip address settings, although if I ever need to I know how to. I fortunately knew how to do ipconfig because I had set up a Minecraft server before so I knew how to find my IPv4 address, I did not know I could use ipconfig /all to display a lot more information. I then learned how to release a DHCP assigned address and obtain one, quick note I found it odd that I needed to complete activity 3 before I could complete activity 4 on the DHCP options, but it was neat to learn this as it feels like I’m finally getting out of the theory phase of things and into the practical’s of learning about the technology I use. Being able to display the contents of a DNS resolver cache using ipconfig /displaydns seemed very useful. When I did it, it showed that I had connected to google which was obvious but still exciting to see what I can do on a simple command prompt, also learning to purge that same resolver cache was google, the activity said it could be useful to know when updating records on a corporate dns server which is cool as that might be something I do in my future career as a web developer.</p>
