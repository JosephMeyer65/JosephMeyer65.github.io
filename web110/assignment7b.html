 <h1>assignment7b</h1>
    <p>I learned how to navigate and extract information from several different sections of a database, It was rather tedious and I actually got lost quite a few times, needing to look back at the reference photo many times, while I understand that we use databases to store and manage large amounts of information, going through them manually felt like a lot of work, but I’m sure it will be useful in many computer related jobs, such as IT, or web development. I can see myself, using what I learned in this session in one of my possible career paths once I graduate.</p>
