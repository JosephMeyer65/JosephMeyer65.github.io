    <p>I feel like I learned a lot during this lesson, not only how to embed videos into a website, which I imagine can be useful for many different types of websites, for example I could see a real estate website uploading videos and embedding them to show a virtual tour through a home that is for sale, but I also learned how to add images, which pretty much every website uses images, to show what they’re selling, or make the website look more interesting. I also got my first introduction to Visual studio code with I’m sure I will be using plenty in my future.</p>
