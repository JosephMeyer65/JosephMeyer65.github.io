    <p>Today I learned the basics of SQL or Sequel, It was very difficult to learn how to use SQL at first, it was very foreign, but after a while I saw its purpose, going through a database manually in the previous assignment was tedious and honestly a little torturous, so knowing I can use SQL to sort through a database and get the exact information I need using commands like SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS; makes databases a lot less intimidating, knowing I can get information such as customer id’s or names, or where they’re from at a moments notice without having to search through different sections of the database and just using a simple line of text. I’m sure there is a lot of use for this in jobs, perhaps I could use this in a data entry job or in IT.</p>
