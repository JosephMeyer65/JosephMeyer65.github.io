    <p>Activity 1 What is accessibility?
 	Learning about accessibility was interesting as it mentioned a disability I have which is color blindless. Websites that color code things in colors I can’t see I tend to try to find an alternative for as I usually can’t tell the difference between the colors. I hadn’t thought about many other visual impairments, but I can see how things like Jaws screen reader can be useful, however specifically the Jaws screen reader kind of hurt my ears and I really hope there are better sounding screen readers out there. This lesson was a good reminder that if I want to make websites that anyone, and everyone can use, I will have to put myself in other people’s shoes, making sure to add options for a broad assortment of possible disabilities.

Activity 2: W3c Markup Validation Service
	Doing this took a long time as I wasn’t quite sure what I did wrong. The first thing I tried to evaluate was my assignment 6a part of my website and it kept telling me that a space wasn’t allowed in part of my code, I erased the space I thought it was only for that to create five more errors, after over an hour of correcting errors and creating new errors I decided to start over, only to realize the space that the error was talking about was in the title of the .jpg file I was using. I had a space between coffee and cup, I spent an hour fixing a syntax error, but after that everything was fixed and there were no errors. Lesson learned, look for the simple stuff first then go hunting through the rest of the code.
