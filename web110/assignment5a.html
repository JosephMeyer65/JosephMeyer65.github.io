    <p>I learned how to create an unordered list in HTML and how to use relative reference links using the a href attribute. I also learned what header tags are and how to use them. This lesson took me longer than I’d like to admit because coding is so foreign to me currently, however even with these basic concepts I can see how they could be used for creating websites in the future. Unordered lists and relative links could be used to link to other parts of a website from a home page, that way you have multiple different parts of a website all dedicated to different things rather than one unorganized mess. That’s what I got out of it at least.</p>
